# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Notes

## Overview
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a specification for managing and exchanging context information between AI models and applications.
- Enables interoperability and consistent context handling across different systems.

## Key Concepts
- **Context**: Data or metadata that influences model behavior (e.g., user preferences, session state).
- **Protocol**: Defines how context is structured, transmitted, and updated.

## Features
- Standardized context schema (JSON/YAML).
- Versioning support for backward compatibility.
- Secure context transmission (encryption, authentication).

## Use Cases
- Personalization in conversational AI.
- Multi-turn dialogue management.
- Cross-application context sharing.
